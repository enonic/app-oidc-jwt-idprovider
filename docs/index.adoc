= Open ID Connect JWT ID Provider

Authenticate your users with JWT tokens issued by a OIDC provider.

This ID provider validates signatures of JWT tokens passed as Bearer tokens in the Authorization header of requests. It does this by calling the well-know endpoint of a OIDC provider to fetch public keys and those keys are then used to validate. It is compatible with all OIDC providers that provide a `jwks_uri` in their well-known configuration.

== Configuration

* In your Enonic XP admin interface
** In the admin tool "Applications", install the application "Open ID Connect JWT ID Provider" .
** In the admin tool "Users", create a ID provider and configure it to use the Open ID Connect JWT ID Provider.
*** Well-known endpoint: The URL to the well known endpoint of you OIDC provider
*** Allowed clients (audience): Optionally restrict allowed clients (audience claims).
*** Username claim: What claim to use for user names.
*** User display name claim: What claim to use for user display names.
*** User email claim: What claim to use for user email.
