= Open ID Connect JWT ID Provider

Authenticate your users with JWT tokens issued by a OIDC provider.
This ID provider calls the well-know endpoint of a OIDC provider to fetch public keys. Those keys are then used to validate signatures of JWT tokens.
It is compatible with all OIDC providers that provide a `jwks_uri` in their well-known configuration.
